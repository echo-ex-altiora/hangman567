# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Installation instructions

```git clone https://github.com/echo-ex-altiora/hangman567.git```

This repository doesn't require any installations outside of the python standard built in library.

## Usage instructions

To play hangman, clone the repository to your computer and open in any software that supports python. 
Run milestone_5.py from terminal using `python milestone_5.py`

If you wish to play with a different word list:
- open milestone_5.py in VScode or using nano in terminal
- find the default word list at the top of the file contained in list : word_list
- edit this list directly or alternatively make a new list and enter your list as the parameter for play_game function.


## File structure of the project

There are five python files in the main folder named hangman. 
- hangman_Template.py
- milestone_2.py
- milestone_3.py
- milestone_4.py
- milestone_5.py

The python file hangman_Template contains a skeleton code with Todos describing how you can code the game yourself.

The 4 milestone python files are each major step and commit made when coding the game with milestone_5.py being the final fully coded game.

In the outside folder HANGMAN567, there is this README.md file and an empty .gitignore file.
